Introduction
============

collective.subscribe contains components for associating users/principals as
subsribers to an item of content, maintaining a relationship between
them, and providing an index for such relationships.

This package provides underlying components that use and integrate with
the Zope Component Architecture (ZCA), and can be used by higher-level
packages providing application-specific uses of the adapters, entities,
utilities, and indexes provided by this package.
